description: Works across every medium, including organic and paid social, print, email marketing, motion graphics, display ads, apparel, and out of home. Iâ€™ve helped evolve the brand and brand style guide, and contributed to and managed the brand asset library. I frequently collaborate with tons of different roles, including marketing, industrial design, engineering (digital and mechanical), network technicians, and PR, and use tools like Lucid Press to enable non-design teams to create and manage their own collateral.
