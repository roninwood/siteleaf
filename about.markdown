[**Résumé**](/uploads/Ronin_Wood_Resume.pdf)

Hi! 

My name is Ronin and welcome to my homepage.
On this site you will find the majority of my work.
You can use tags to sort through all the chaos if that
helps. I will be doing my best to document most of
my public facing work on this site. Have a great day
and never stop working toward your goal!

Ronin
