# About

I was most recently the Lead Designer on the Marketing and Brand team at [Celtra](http://celtra.com). I've worked at large, established tech companies, early stage startups, political campaigns, direct-to-consumer brands, and even as a designer at an off-Broadway show.

Based in Brooklyn, originally from southern Virginia. Big fan of pizza. Big fan of making pizza at home. [Big fan of these songs](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4m1O4IBKp8SEb8S4qoMzcp?si=DDXByu0vTAq_Q6n-6ilIiw).

## Contact
I'm open to freelance, contact work, and select full-time opportunities. Reach out if you have something you'd love some help on! Excited to help you with anything from your big and exciting brand campaigns to resizing JPGs for social.
